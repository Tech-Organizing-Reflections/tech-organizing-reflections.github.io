      <p><strong>Cella M. Sum</strong> is a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Her research focuses on technology, power, and resistance in labor contexts. Using community-based participatory design methods, she works with affected communities to co-create more just alternatives. She is an organizer with Against Carceral Tech, a member of Collective Action in Tech, and a former tech worker organizer with Big Cartel Workers Union.</p>

      <p><strong>Christoph Becker</strong> is Professor at the Faculty of Information and a Fellow of the SDG Scholars Academy at the University of Toronto. He leads the Just Sustainability Design lab (www.justsustainabilitydesign.org). With a background in computer science and informatics, his research today focuses on enacting meaningful change in computing to meet the urgent need for sustainability and social justice (converging in just sustainability) at a time when the world is grappling with unprecedented ecological, political and societal crises. His book <em>Insolvent: How to reorient computing for just sustainability</em> appeared at MIT Press in 2023.</p>

      <p><strong>Pedro Reynolds-Cuéllar</strong> is a Colombian researcher and designer working on research surrounding how robotics and other automated systems intersect with society. This includes aspects of its design, dissemination, regulation and further integration in sociotechnical environments. This research is built on methods from Participatory Design, Science, Technology and Society studies, and Human-Computer Interaction. It is grounded in principles of participation, justice, and accountability.</p>

      <p><strong>Lynn Dombrowski</strong> uses design and empirical methods to explore how computing technologies might address social inequality. She designs and prototypes human-centered computing technologies for intervening in large systemic social issues like social and economic inequalities (e.g., hunger; wage violations). Her work contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction, ubiquitous and social computing, and design. She explores themes of power, empowerment, politics, ethics, values, advocacy, and social justice within the context of sociotechnical systems.</p>

      <p><strong>Dr. Peaks Krafft</strong> (they/them) is Lecturer in Computational Sociology and Co-Director of the MSc Digital Sociology at the University of Edinburgh. Dr. Peaks engages in social justice-oriented computing research and organising.</p>

      <p><strong>Jensine Raihan</strong> (they/she) is an Informatics PhD student at University of California, Irvine. They hold a BS in computer science from New York University and worked as a community organizer building abolitionist systems to address gender-based violence within working-class Desi communities in New York City. Their research lies at the intersection of Science and Technology Studies, Human-Computer Interaction, Participatory Design and Postcolonial Theory, focusing on the conditions of subjective formation that support genuine democratic participation in society and emancipatory technological design.</p>

      <p><strong>Alicia DeVrio</strong> is a PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Her research explores how structurally disempowered people use their own counter-power to resist ordinary and harmful impacts of algorithmic systems.</p>

      <p><strong>Linda Huber</strong> is a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan’s School of Information, where she researches how emerging digital technologies are reshaping business models and organizational practices. Using ethnographic methods, her work focuses on datafication and platformization in the healthcare industry, contributing to feminist science and technology studies (STS), organization studies, and critical data studies. She is also an organizer in tech-ademia, and has been leading the roving "ACM Strike School" since 2022.</p>

      <p><strong>Maggie Hughes</strong> is a designer and researcher exploring technologies that support democratic practice and grassroots power building through community-centered design and participatory research. As a Ph.D. candidate at MIT Media Lab's Center for Constructive Communication and Microsoft Sociotechnical Systems Fellow, she collaborates with local organizers on initiatives like Real Talk in Boston and has designed systems to increase transparency and accountability in governance through the Voice-to-Insights project with the NYC Department of City Planning. Her work spans teaching alongside Marshall Ganz in Harvard's People, Power, Change and co-designing MIT's Designing Constructive Communication Systems course.</p>
